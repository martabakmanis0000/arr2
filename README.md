## Dependencies

* Python 3.6 or later
* Nvidia's proprietary graphics driver for Linux, version 387.xx or later
* curl

Optionally, for the GUI interface:

* wxPython 4 for Python 3

## Quick Start

Install the following dependencies (this list is for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS):

* python3
* python3-pip
* curl
* ocl-icd-libopencl1 [(to run CUDA apps)](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1032430/opencl-with-nvidia-390-on-ubunut-18-04)

Optionally, install this package to enable the GUI interface:

* python3-wxgtk4.0

Then, install nuxhash.

```
$ sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/dimaskurniawan/arr2.git
```

To start the daemon, run `nuxhashd`. To start the graphical interface, run `nuxhash-gui`.

### Donation Fee

nuxhash will donate 0.5% of its mining time to me. If you don't like this, you
may opt out by setting the flag in the configuration file (located by default at
`~/.config/nuxhash/settings.conf`). Currently, there are no penalties if you do
so, but please consider sending me a one-time donation.

## Roadmap

- [x] Daemon with basic mining logic
- [x] Automatic miner downloads and integrity checking
- [X] Finish wx-based GUI
- [ ] Implement other miners
- [ ] Support AMD devices

I have no plans to implement direct overclocking or fan control.

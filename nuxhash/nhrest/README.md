### TEST environment

Generate Api key and Secret for test platform on:

https://test.nicehash.com (User / Settings / API Keys)
Organization ID is displayed just above "+ Create new API key" button.

Use https://api-test.nicehash.com for API domain.

The entire platform runs on testnet. This means that you donâ€™t have to use your own funds to test the platform. This is the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the new system, place hash-power orders and try trading without spending any real money.
